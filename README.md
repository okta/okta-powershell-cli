## Security recommendations

We recommend limiting the access permissions of your Okta.PowerShell scripts to only authorized users. 

Add the appropriate users or groups and assign the necessary permissions to the `OktaConfiguration.ps1` file (Full Control, Read & Execute, etc.), and remove any unnecessary users or groups from the list.

:Warning: The `OktaConfiguration.ps1` file contains secrets, so we recommend using least privilege access to the configuration file.

> Note: For more information about PowerShell script security, check out [the official PowerShell security guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/learn-script-security).

## Usage guide

### Prerequisites 

The PowerShell module uses the [device authorization flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/) to obtain an access token, so it requires, at least, three configuration values. These are the
values for the [Okta Org domain](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/find-your-domain/main/), the client ID of the [OIDC Native Application](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/11/12/native-sso) 
and the scope for the API grants you are going to need. For example, if you are going to get groups then you will need the grant `okta.groups.read` configured in your scope. Make sure to assign the application to anyone that needs access to it.

### non-admin users

Non-admin users will require to be granted specific permissions to perform certain tasks and access resources.

Check out the following resources to learn more:
* [Custom admin roles](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/custom-admin-role/work-with-admin.htm)
* [Standard admin roles and permissions](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/administrators-admin-comparison.htm)

### Set your configuration and execute commands 

1. Set your configuration

```powershell
$Configuration = Get-OktaConfiguration
$Configuration.BaseUrl = 'https://myorg.okta.com'
$Configuration.ClientId = 'MY_CLIENT_ID'
$Configuration.Scope = "okta.groups.read" # or "okta.groups.read okta.apps.read"
```

2. Authorize your device

```powershell
Invoke-OktaEstablishAccessToken
```
> Note: You have to open the browser and navigate to the provided URL to complete the flow. Once the device is authorized, go back to the PowerShell terminal.

3. Invoke commands

```powershell
Invoke-OktaListGroups

id                    : 00g9erf7s3ydK79IX5d7
created               : 5/5/23 1:45:05 PM
lastUpdated           : 5/5/23 1:45:05 PM
lastMembershipUpdated : 5/5/23 1:45:05 PM
objectClass           : {okta:user_group}
type                  : OKTA_GROUP
profile               : @{name=Sales; description=}
_links                : @{logo=System.Object[]; users=; apps=}
```

> Note: For more details about commands, check out the [documentation for API endpoints](/API_README.md)

> Note: If you want to remove the access token from configuration you can execute `Invoke-OktaRemoveAccessToken`

### Configure a proxy

```powershell
$proxyUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
$webProxy = New-Object System.Net.WebProxy($proxyUrl)
$Configuration.Proxy = $webProxy
```
4. Revoke your access token

Starting in Okta.PowerShell v2.x series, you can execute the following command to [revoke your token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens):

```powershell
Invoke-OktaRevokeAccessToken
```
Notice this will also remove the access token from your Okta configuration

### Create objects

The Okta PowerShell Module supports two approaches for object creation: 

1. The "Initialize-Object" command 
2. Using PowerShell's native `PSCustomObject` for creating objects

#### Create the object manually using PowerShell's native `PSCustomObject` and the [API reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/overview/)

You can check out the API reference to explore what the payload structure should look like for the operation you want to perform. For example, if you want to create a group, check out the [Add Group API reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/addGroup) and look for the request sample. For this particular operation, you will see that the payload should look like the following:

```json
{
    "profile": {
        "description": "All users West of The Rockies",
        "name": "West Coast users"
    }
}
```

Then you can recreate the same payload using `PSCustomObject`:

```powershell
$Group = [PSCustomObject]@{ 
            profile = [PSCustomObject]@{
                description = "All users West of the Rockies"
                name = "West Coast users"}
    }

$NewGroup = New-OktaGroup -Group $Group
```

:warning: If you follow this approach, you have to ensure the casing is correct. Notice that for this particular operation, all the properties of the group payload are in lowercase.

#### Create the object using "Initialize-Object" command 

The Okta PowerShell Module provides an "Initialize-Object" command that simplifies the creation and initialization of most of the objects. Each object represents a distinct entity supported by the Okta PowerShell Module, and this command provides a standardized approach to create and configure these objects. 

Following the same "Create group" example as in the previous step, you can create a group object by executing the corresponding "Initialize-Object" commands:

```powershell
$GroupProfile = Initialize-OktaGroupProfile -Name "West Coast users" -Description "All users West of the Rockies"
$Group = Initialize-OktaGroup -VarProfile $GroupProfile
$NewGroup = New-OktaGroup -Group $Group
```

Notice that for objects that have nested properties, each nested property may itself be an object that needs to be initialized separately. In such cases make sure to:

1. Initialize each nested property individually.
2. Pass the nested object(s) as part of the -Property parameter when initializing the parent object.

Always verify the required structure and types for nested properties by consulting the [API reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/overview/).

### Get a user

```powershell
$User = Get-OktaUser -UserId "foo"
```         

### Create a user

```powershell
$UserProfile = [PSCustomObject]@{
                firstName = 'John'
                lastName = 'Doe'
                login = 'john.doe@mail.com'
                email = 'john.doe@mail.com'
            }

$CreateUserRequest = Initialize-OktaCreateUserRequest -VarProfile $UserProfile -GroupIds 'foo'
$TestResult = New-OktaUser -Body $CreateUserRequest
```

> Note: If you initialize objects using `PSCustomObject`, ensure the casing is correct.

### Create a user with password

```powershell
$UserProfile = [PSCustomObject]@{
                firstName = 'John'
                lastName = 'Doe'
                login = 'john.doe@mail.com'
                email = 'john.doe@mail.com'
            }

$UserCredentials = [PSCustomObject]@{ 
                    password = [PSCustomObject]@{ value = 'Hell0W0rld'} 
                }

$CreateUserRequest = Initialize-OktaCreateUserRequest -VarProfile $UserProfile -Credentials $UserCredentials
$TestResult = New-OktaUser -Body $CreateUserRequest
```
> Note: If you initialize objects using `PSCustomObject`, ensure the casing is correct.

Alternatively, you can use the Initialize commands to create the user payload:

```powershell
$UserProfile = Initialize-OktaUserProfile -Email "joe.doe@mail.com" -Login "joe.doe@mail.com" -FirstName "Joe" -LastName "Doe"
$UserCredentials = Initialize-OktaUserCredentials -Password "Hell0W0rld!"

$CreateUserRequest = Initialize-OktaCreateUserRequest -VarProfile $UserProfile -Credentials $UserCredentials
$TestResult = New-OktaUser -Body $CreateUserRequest
```
### List users with pagination

```powershell
$Users  = Invoke-OktaListUsers -Limit 10 
```

Utilize the `-withHttpInfo` flag to retrieve additional response properties, including `NextPageUri` for accessing the subsequent page of results. Additionally, you can seamlessly access all response headers through the Headers property.

To paginate results, use `Uri` param, which allows passing absolute URIs:

```powershell
$UsersResponse  = Invoke-OktaListUsers -Limit 10 -withHttpInfo

While ($UsersResponse.NextPageUri)
{
    $UsersResponse = Invoke-OktaListUsers -Uri $UsersResponse.NextPageUri  -withHttpInfo #This time you can pass the absolute Uri with already contains query params such as "limit" or/and "after"
    $UsersList =  $UsersResponse.Response
}
```

### Create an application

```powershell
$OAuthClient = [PSCustomObject]@{
                client_uri = "https://example.com/client"
                logo_uri = "https://example.com/assets/images/logo-new.png"
                response_types = @("token", "id_token", "code")
                redirect_uris = @("https://example.com/oauth2/callback", "myapp://callback")
                post_logout_redirect_uris = @("https://example.com/postlogout", "myapp://postlogoutcallback")
                grant_types = @("implicit", "authorization_code")
                application_type = "native"
                tos_uri = "https://example.com/client/tos"
                policy_uri = "https://example.com/client/policy"
            }
# a simple test to create an object
$Settings = Initialize-OktaOpenIdConnectApplicationSettings -OauthClient $OAuthClient

$NewApp = Initialize-OktaOpenIdConnectApplication -Label "New App" -SignOnMode "OPENID_CONNECT" -Settings $Settings

```

> Note: If you initialize objects using `PSCustomObject`, ensure the casing is correct.

> Note: Null values are removed from the payload by default. If you want to include null values you have to include the `-IncludeNullValues` flag.

> Note: For more API samples checkout our [tests](https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli/tree/main/tests/)

### List resources that match a filter criteria

Certain Okta APIs allow you to list a subset of resources that match a supported filter expression, query, or search criteria. For example, the Groups API enables you to provide filter criteria via query parameters to return a subset of groups. **These query parameters require URL encoding, which is handled internally by the Okta.PowerShell module**. This ensures that your queries are correctly formatted and processed by the Okta API without any additional effort on your part.

#### List groups using the `search` parameter

* Search groups that are of the type `OKTA_GROUP`:

```powershell
Invoke-OktaListGroups -Search 'type eq "OKTA_GROUP"'
```

Internally, the Okta.PowerShell module will encode the search criteria as `/api/v1/groups?search=type+eq+%22OKTA_GROUP%22`.

* Search groups which name is equals to `IAM Team`:

```powershell
Invoke-OktaListGroups -Search 'profile.name eq "IAM Team"'
```
Internally, the Okta.PowerShell module will encode the search criteria as `/api/v1/groups?search=profile.name+eq+%22IAM+Team%22`.

#### List groups using the `filter` parameter

* Filter groups that are of the type `OKTA_GROUP` with profile updated after 11/11/2015

```powershell
Invoke-OktaListGroups -Filter 'type eq "OKTA_GROUP" and lastUpdated gt "2016-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"'
```

Internally, the Okta.PowerShell module will encode the filter criteria as `/api/v1/groups?filter=lastUpdated+gt+%222015-10-05T00%3a00%3a00.000Z%22`.

* Filter groups by ID

```powershell
$GroupId = "00g6hmia52o0aTHx35d7"
Invoke-OktaListGroups -Filter "id eq `"$GroupId`""
```
> Note: Notice `$GroupId` is enclosed in double quotes.

Internally, the Okta.PowerShell module will encode the filter criteria as `/api/v1/groups?filter=id+eq+%2200g6hmia52o0aTHx35d7%22`.

#### List groups using the `q` parameter

Finds a group that matches the name property

```powershell
Invoke-OktaListGroups -Q "everyone"
```

### Get logs

Since the System Log API requires `since` and `until` query params to be ISO 8601 compliant timestamp, make sure to format dates accordingly:

```powershell
$since = (Get-Date).AddMonths(-6).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
$until = (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
Get-OktaLogs -since $since -until $until

```

## Error Handling 

Starting in Okta.PowerShell 2.x series we introduced a new exception called `OktaApiException` which is thrown when requests to the Okta API result in 4xx/5xx errors. You can catch an `OktaApiException` and access the Okta API error details. For example, if the API returns a 429 response with the following content: `{"errorCode":"E0000047","errorSummary":"API call exceeded rate limit due to too many requests.","errorLink":"E0000047","errorId":"oae6dB62BdhRFCF_9ltxiklFQ","errorCauses":[]}`, you can access these details from the exception:

```powershell
    try{
        $Result = Invoke-OktaListApplications
    }
    catch{
        $_.Exception.StatusCode.Value__ | Should -Be 429;
        $_.Exception.ErrorCode | Should -Be "E0000047"
        $_.Exception.ErrorSummary | Should -Be "API call exceeded rate limit due to too many requests."
        $_.Exception.ErrorLink | Should -Be "E0000047"
        $_.Exception.ErrorId | Should -Be "oae6dB62BdhRFCF_9ltxiklFQ"
        $_.Exception.ErrorCauses | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
        $_.Exception.Headers | Should -Not -Be $null
    }

```

## Rate Limiting

The Okta API will return 429 responses if too many requests are made within a given time. Please see [Rate Limiting at Okta] for a complete list of which endpoints are rate limited.  When a 429 error is received, the `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` header will tell you the time at which you can retry. This section discusses  methods for handling rate limiting with this SDK.

### Built-In Retry

The Okta.PowerShell module uses a built-in retry strategy to automatically retry on 429 errors.

You can configure the following options when using the built-in retry strategy:

| Configuration Option | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| RequestTimeout         | The waiting time in milliseconds for a request to be resolved by the client. Less than or equal to 0 means "no timeout". The default value is `$null` (None). |
| MaxRetries             | The number of times to retry. |

If the request still fails with a 429 status code after retrying it the specified number of times or if the Okta API returns an Http error other than 429 after retying a request, an `OktaApiException` will be ultimately thrown.

### Usage

```powershell
$Config = Get-OktaConfiguration
$Config.MaxRetries = 2
$Config.RequestTimeout = 6000 

# Invoke your commands as usual
$Result = Invoke-OktaListApplications 
```

### API Token Authentication

The module supports API token authentication using the `ApiKey` parameter. The token is automatically prefixed with "SSWS" (the Okta API token prefix) when making requests.

**Recommended Usage with Set-OktaConfiguration:**
```powershell
Set-OktaConfiguration -BaseUrl 'https://your-org.okta.com' -ApiKey @{ apitoken = '<yourApiToken>' }
```

**Alternative: Direct Configuration Object:**
```powershell
$Configuration = Get-OktaConfiguration
$Configuration.BaseUrl = 'https://your-org.okta.com'
$Configuration.ApiKey = @{ apitoken = '<yourApiToken>' }
```

The resulting HTTP header will be:
```powershell
Authorization: SSWS <yourApiToken>
```

**Custom Prefix (Optional):**
If you need to use a different prefix, you can set `ApiKeyPrefix`:
```powershell
Set-OktaConfiguration -BaseUrl 'https://your-org.okta.com' -ApiKey @{ apitoken = '<yourApiToken>' } -ApiKeyPrefix "Bearer"
```

**Alternative: Manual Authorization Header**
You can also manually set the Authorization header if needed:
```powershell
$Configuration = Get-OktaConfiguration
$Configuration.BaseUrl = 'https://your-org.okta.com'
$Configuration.DefaultHeaders = @{ authorization = 'SSWS <yourApiToken>' }
```
